# Basic Portfolio (HTML && CSS)

## Description 

My portfolio was remastered using basic html and css characteristics.

# Challenge / Why? 

This project was first presented to me at the beginning of the SMU Full-Stack coding bootcamp program. It was necessary for me to revisit this assignment and polish it, simply to sharpen my skills. Also, a potential employer may come across this plus my other work so a good first impression is imperative!
